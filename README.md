# Friendly Reminder Bot

### A friendly reminder twitter bot to keep you healthy and happy.

Original idea: https://twitter.com/ykdojo/status/1524428290290638848

### How will it work?

We're going to write a piece of code that takes a random line from reminders.txt, and this bot will tweet it at a random time interval between 1-7 hours.

So it'll tweet every 4 hours on average, which gives us 6 tweets / day.
